Working as of 2023-10-24

Note that `GISTools` was archived for failing to update in 2022, and `SDMTools` was archived in 2019. Output files are run with retiring R-spatial packages and `GISTools` on the library path, output `_rev` files without retiring R-spatial packages on the library path.

This book is a part of project supported by the Polish National Science Center (NCN) on „Spatial econometric models with fixed and changing neighborhood structure. Application for real estate valuation and business location” (OPUS 12, contract no. UMO-2016/23/B/ HS4/02363).

Each *.txt file includes codes used in the book in given chapter, to replicate all analyses presented on example data. 
Example data include shapefile maps as well as datasets. 
Shapefiles are for Poland on NTS0, NTS2 and NTS4 levels. These are open data from http://www.gugik.gov.pl
Datasets are also for Poland, collected from Central Statistical Office (www.stat.gov.pl). These are NTS4 socio-economic data and geo-coded point data.
